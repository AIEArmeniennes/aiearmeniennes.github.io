The monastery of St Dad (Dadi, Dadē) or Dadivankʻ, also called
Khutʻavankʻ, is located on a flat area overlooking the left bank of the
Těrtu/Tʻartʻaṛ/Terter river. It is named after a legendary disciple of
the apostle Thaddeus, who was supposed to have come to evangelise
Artsʻakh as early as the first century AD, and to have been martyred and
buried on the site of the monastery. The date of the actual foundation
of Dadivankʻ is unknown. It was destroyed by the Seljuk Turks in
1145-1146 and rebuilt from the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> century onwards, with
most of its buildings dating from the 13<sup>th</sup> century. It was then an
episcopal seat and the religious centre of the principality of Upper
Khachʻēn. The complex was the subject of a major excavation and
restoration campaign from 1997 to 2011.

Dadivankʻ is one of the largest conventual complexes in medieval
Armenia. Its twenty or so preserved buildings give a fairly complete
picture of the organisation of an Armenian monastery (Fig. 1).
Three functional groups correspond to the main spheres of monastic life:
a) the worship group to the north, with two churches, two chapels, two
narthexes, a campanile and a gallery; b) the group of monastic
activities to the south (refectory, kitchen, chapter house, library and
scriptorium \[presumed functions\]); c) the residential group to the
south-west (with, in particular, a two-storey hostelry), completed with
an oil press and a cellar.

In the northern part of the worship group, a large and wide single-nave
church, curiously, it seems, unfinished (or designed to be covered in
wood?), includes, in its eastern part, a funerary and memorial area
comprising a pit, a stela and a tomb. These could be part of the (early
Christian?) remains of the martyrium of St Dad. At a short distance to
the south-east, the main church, *katʻoghikē*, although modest in plan,
is the dominant building of the complex (Fig. 2, 3). The long
inscription engraved on its southern façade indicates that it was built
in 1214 by Princess Arzukhatʻun in memory of her husband Vakhtang and
her sons Hasan and Grigor, who "died prematurely" (Fig. 4). The
church has a dome on an inscribed cross and a compact plan. Its lower
half has rather squat proportions, counterbalanced by the height of the
large 14-sided drum with a pyramidal dome.

The church is the only one to be clad in carefully hewn blocks and is
enlivened, especially at the level of the drum, by the contrast between
its brick-coloured masonry and the blind colonnade-arcade carved in
white stone. At the top of the south and east façades, two pairs of
figures are sculpted in low relief on either side of the church model.
They may represent the saintly dedicatee of the monastery and Prince
Vakhtang on the east side; and the latter's sons on the south side. The
princes, who died before the construction, are haloed, but unlike the
saint, whose head is entirely surrounded by a large nimbus, each of them
is depicted with a small disc behind his head. They wear a high
headdress typical of high-ranking nobles during the Georgian period.
While the two princes on the south façade are shown full-height, wearing
a long cloak tight around the waist, on the east façade the figures are
shown in bust form; but it is possible that these sculptures have been
deprived of their lower parts as a result of reworking. The bust of the
saint, whose image is simplified, may have been sculpted anew on this
occasion. Inside, two painted compositions partially cover the side
walls: the Enthronement of St Nicholas on the south wall, and the
Stoning of St Stephen on the north wall (Fig.4). These
paintings, dated by inscription to 1297 and restored in 2014-15 by
Christine Lamoureux and Ara Zarian, distinguish themselves by their
quality----in particular, by the finesse of the design and the
expressiveness of the faces. Accompanied by captions in Armenian, they
attest the existence of a high-level local art school, along with the
attachment of the princes and the monastic community to the Armenian
tradition and language.

To the south of the worship group, a chapel with a dome over an
inscribed cross, with rustic masonry and a tile roof, is isolated in the
courtyard (Fig. 5). Its high, slightly tapered cone-shaped drum
is built mainly of brick. It is undated, but houses a *khachʻkʻar* whose
inscription states that it was erected in 1182 by Prince Hasan, son of
Vakhtang----who became a monk and a member of the brotherhood. The
narthex in front of the large single-nave church was built, as an
inscription indicates, in 1224 by the superior Grigoris III. Much wider
than it is long, it is of a type most common in Armenia at the time:
four pillars support the dome with a central skylight, but it is
distinguished by the slightly ogee shape of its arches. At the western
end of the gallery that extends in front of the door of the main church
stands a campanile whose modest appearance enhanced the splendour of the
two *khachʻkʻar*s that it housed until recently (Fig. 6).
Sculptures of exceptional refinement and virtuosity, dated to 1283, they
are among the most beautiful *khachʻkʻar*s to be found in Armenia. After
the cession of the territory to Azerbaijan in 2020, for fear of
destruction or amputation, these two masterpieces were transferred to
Ējmiatsin.

Further south, in the centre of the second group, a large hall with a
square plan is referred to as a *tachar* (= palace, hall, temple) in its
construction inscription of 1211. It is believed that it was actually
founded slightly earlier and then remodelled, and that it corresponded
to a chapter house. It has the same structure as the large narthex, with
a truncated dome reposing on four columns. Its orientation is the same
as that of the domed chapel, slightly deviated to the south-east if
compared with the other buildings, which may indicate that the two
buildings were erected at the same time, at a relatively early date,
towards the end of the 12<sup>th</sup> century.
