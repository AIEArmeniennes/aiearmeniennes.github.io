In the course of the Christianisation of the Southern Caucasus in the
4<sup>th</sup>–5<sup>th</sup> centuries of our era, a third language of the region, along
with Armenian and Georgian, was equipped with an alphabet to be used for
writing down biblical texts. The language is usually named "Albanian" in
accordance with Greek sources that denote the region in question,
north-east of antique Armenia, as Ἀλβανία and its inhabitants as
ἄλβανοι, a designation that is also concealed in the Armenian name,
*Aghuankʽ* \[Bais 2001 and 2023; Dum-Tragut/Gippert 2023\]; there is no
relation with the (Indo-European) Albanian language of the Balkans. Even
though the existence of the [Albanian script](/artsakh/Alb-script/) and Christian texts
written in it had been a topos since Antiquity, esp. in the historical
accounts of Koryun and other Armenian authors, it took until 1832 for
the first elements of the Albanian language to be identified in a list
of month names written in Armenian characters in an Armenian manuscript
of Paris (BNF, arménien 252, 43v)\[Brosset 1832; Gippert et al. 2008,
II-94-95; Gippert 2023, 221-225\], and the first specimen of written
Albanian came to light only in 1937 when an alphabet list of the
*Aghuankʽ* was detected in a 13<sup>th</sup>-century Armenian manuscript of the
Matenadaran in Yerevan (M 7337, 145rv) (see [Albanian script](/artsakh/Alb-script/)). A
few years later, in 1948, some inscriptions whose letters bore enough
similarities with the alphabet list to be regarded as Albanian were
unearthed near the Kura reservoir in Mingachevir \[Qaziyev 1948,
399-401; Vahidov/Fomenko 1951, 97-98; Gippert 2023, 97-99\]; however, no
reliable reading was possible until the 1990s when the remnants of
Albanian manuscripts were detected in the lower layer of two Georgian
palimpsest codices of St Catherine's Monastery on Mt Sinai
\[Aleksidze/Mahé 1997; Gippert et al. 2008; Gippert 2023, 99-141\]. With
the decipherment of the Albanian palimpsests, which turned out to
contain biblical matter, comprising about half of the Gospel of John
from an evangeliary and pericopes from the other Gospels as well as the
Acts of Apostles, the Pauline and Catholic Epistles, and the prophet
Isaiah together with Psalm verses, the structure and the lexicon of the
Albanian language have meanwhile been established with certainty
\[Gippert et al. 2008, II-1-84 and IV-1-71; Gippert/Schulze 2023\]. It
is clear now that the Albanian language was a member of the (North-)East
Caucasian family, more exactly its Lezgic branch, with the modern [Udi language](/artsakh/Udi-lang/) being its closest relative (if not its direct descendant)
\[Gippert et al. 2008, II-65-78; Schulze/Gippert 2023\]. This is proven
not only by a great bulk of common items from the basic lexicon
(especially verbs) but also by straightforward matches in the
grammatical structure that can be regarded as decisive (for details see
[Udi language](/artsakh/Udi-lang/)).

In the palimpsests with their biblical content (see Figures 1-2 showing
passages from the 1<sup>st</sup> Letter of John and the Letter of James in the
undertext of Sin. georg. NF 13, 4v), the Albanian language presents
itself as strongly influenced not only by the neighbouring Christian
traditions but also by other factors. The shape of biblical names proves
that the Albanian Bible, at least the Gospel of John, was grounded on a
Semitic, i.e. Syriac, tradition. This is clearly indicated by name forms
like that of the lake Siloah (John 9.7 and 11) which appears as
*šiloha-* in the palimpsests, thus matching Syriac *šilōhāʾ* and
contrasting with Armenian *siłovam* and Georgian *siloam-* which both
reflect Greek Σιλωάμ. Similarly, the name of the Samaritans appears as
*šamra-* (John 4.9, 39-40; 8.48) matching Syriac *šāmrā-* and
contrasting with Armenian *samaracʽi* and Georgian *samariṭel-*, which
both again show the *s-* of Greek Σαμαρίτης \[Gippert/Schulze 2023, 108
and 217-218\]. The name of Moses appears in different forms in the
Gospel of John and the other biblical texts of the palimpsests, which
stem from a lectionary: in the former, it is *mowše-* (John 1.17; 5.45;
7.22) matching Syriac *mowšeʾ* while the latter have *mowsēs* (Matthew
17.3; Acts 13.38; Hebrews 3.2, 5; 11.24) in agreement with Armenian
*movsēs*, Georgian *mose-* and Greek Μωϋσῆς, thus suggesting that the
two palimpsested Albanian manuscripts represent different strata of the
Bible translation in the language. However, "Syriacisms" are also found
in the lectionary part as in the case of the name of the Sadducees which
appears as *zadoḳa-* in Matthew 22.23, with its *z-* matching Syriac
*zadūqā-* and opposing itself to *s-* in Armenian *sadowkecʽi* and
Georgian *saduḳevel-* which reflect Greek Σαδδουκαῖος \[Gippert/Schulze
2023, 140-141\].

In its vocabulary, the Albanian language reveals influences from both
Armenian and Georgian, especially in the core of Christian terminology
\[Gippert/Schulze 2023, 219-220\]. So we find Georgian *aġvseba-*
'Easter' in Albanian *axsiba-*/*axc̣iba-* 'id.' (continued in modern Udi
as *axsibay/axc̣ima*), *madl-i* 'mercy, grace' in Albanian *madil'*
'id.', *savrʒel-i* 'seat, see' in Albanian *sabowrzel* 'id.', and *saxē*
'face, appearance, vision' in Albanian *saxē* 'id.'. The word for
'Friday', Albanian *ṗarasḳe* (\> Udi *p/ṗarask/ḳi*) matches Georgian
*ṗarasḳev-i*, in its turn reflecting Greek παρασκευή, and Albanian
*angelos*- 'angel', *eḳlesi-* 'church' and *ḳeisar-* 'emperor' \< Greek
ἄγγελος, ἐκκληςία and καῖσαρ are likely to have entered the language via
Georgian *angelos-*, *eḳ(ḳ)lesia-*, and *ḳeysar-* (vs. Armenian
*hreštak*, *ekełecʽi*, and *kaysar*). A true Armenian loan word is
Albanian *marmin'* 'body, flesh' while *hetanos*- 'heathen, Gentile' and
*salmos*- 'psalm' are Greek words (ἔθνος, ψαλμός) in a peculiar Armenian
disguise (*hetʽanos*, *sałmos*). An Armenian loan must also be the word
for 'congregation, synagogue' which always appears abbreviated as *ž˜d-*
in the Albanian palimpsests; the abbreviation obviously reflects
Armenian *zhoghovurd*. A large bulk of the Albanian lexicon consists of
Iranianisms, i.e. borrowings from Middle Iranian languages that were
prevalent in the region in Antiquity; some but not all of them are
matched by corresponding borrowings in Armenian and/or Georgian such as
*žam‑* 'hour, time' \~ Armenian *zham*, Georgian *žam-* \< Middle
Iranian \**žam* 'id.' or *asṗarez-* 'stadion' \~ Armenian *asparēs*,
Georgian *asparez*- \< Middle Iranian \**asparēs* 'turning point of
horse (races)'. A peculiar Iranianism in Albanian is e.g. *bamgen*
'blessed' (\< Middle Iranian \**bāmgēn* 'splendid'), and *marġaven-*
'prophet' reflects an Iranian word for 'bird-seer' similar to Armenian
*margarē-* 'id.' but with a different verbal formation included
(\**marγa-wēn-* vs. \**marγa-δē‑*) \[Gippert 2005; Gippert/Schulze 2023,
215-217\].

The decipherment of the palimpsests also facilitated the reading of the
seven genuine Albanian inscriptions that have been unearthed so far (all
in Mingachevir) \[Gippert et al. 2008, II-85-94; Gippert 2023,
142-148\]. Only one of them is of both linguistic and historical
interest, namely, a four-part text line preserved on what is likely to
have been the pedestal of a cross. Even though it is badly damaged, it
clearly provides the name of a Sasanian emperor in whose 27<sup>th</sup> reignal
year the cross was erected. With the name form *xosroow*- (see Figures
3-5) it may refer to either one of the two emperors named Khosrow (I
Anushirvan, r. 531-579, and II Parviz, r. 590-628), thus yielding the
years 557 and 616 as possible dates of the commemorated event. Even
though for neither the inscriptions nor the palimpsested manuscripts any
more precise dating is available, it is thus probable that the Albanian
language ceased to be written shortly after the end of the Sasanian
dominion in the Caucasus, along with the termination of the autocephaly
of the Albanian church during the Arab rule in about the 8<sup>th</sup> century.
