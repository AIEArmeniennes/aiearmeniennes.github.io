Mentioned in the 10<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> centuries as the episcopal seat of
the principality of Khachʻēn, the monastery was built mainly in the
13<sup>th</sup> century. From the 14<sup>th</sup> to the beginning of the 19<sup>th</sup> century,
Gandzasar was the seat of the "Catholicos of Caucasian Albania", a title
which had lost its ethnic connotation and which possessed a regional
meaning. Several restorations are attested from the 16<sup>th</sup> century to
the present day. From the end of the 17<sup>th</sup>, the Gandzasar catholicoi
were at the forefront of the movement of liberation of Armenia from
Persian and Ottoman domination.

Gandzasar is a classic example of the core of medieval Armenian
monasteries: the combination of the main church and the narthex attached
to its western façade (Fig. 1). The unusually long construction
period of these two edifices (almost fifty years in total) reflects the
complexity of the conditions created by the unrest that preceded the
Mongol invasion, the invasion itself and the subsequent occupation.
Indeed, the inscriptions attest that the church of St John the Baptist
was built between 1216 and 1238 by Prince Hasan Jalal-Dawla (an Armenian
prince, despite his Arab-Persian names), and consecrated in 1240, and
that the narthex (*zhamatun*) was founded by Hasan, his wife and their
son Atʻabak, and completed by the latter in 1261 (or 1266), after the
death of his father in 1260 or 1261.

These long works resulted in an exceptional quality of the edifices. The
church is a construction with a dome over a partitioned, inscribed
cross. It reproduces a composition very common in medieval Armenian
monasteries: the four supports of the cupola are indivisible from the
masonry of the four angular sacristy-chapels, each with two floors. The
church is clad with very regularly cut blocks. Its elegant silhouette is
strongly animated by the pairs of dihedral niches, the fine blind
colonnade-arcade of the façades and, above all, by the high and wide
sixteen-sided drum, punctuated by sixteen clusters of half-columns and
topped by an umbrella-like dome which magnifies the verticality of the
lines of the whole (Fig. 2). A brilliant creation of Armenian
medieval architecture, the umbrella finds here one of its most
outstanding manifestations.

The carved decoration is unusually abundant and of great diversity and
quality—both in human and animal figures and in the elaborate plant
and geometric ornamentation. The human figures are concentrated on the
drum and on the west gable. On the latter is carved one of the rare
Armenian monumental representations of Christ on the cross (Fig. 3). The treatment, however, is sufficiently hieratic and
stylized, so that the image may not directly be associated with the
human sufferings of Jesus Christ whom Armenian iconography generally
prefers to show in his divine glory. There are numerous portraits of
donors, certainly members of the Hasan-Jalalian dynasty. On the west
gable, two of them are kneeling on either side of Christ, wearing the
headgear of the Georgian nobility. One is struck by the clearly
almond-shaped eyes of Christ, the angels and the princes, a sign perhaps
of the choice of the latter to swear allegiance to the Mongols. On the
south side of the drum, princesses and princes—who were probably
deceased at the time of construction—wear a nimbus. On the western
side of the drum, two bearded and moustached donors—presumably Hasan
and his father Vakhtang—are depicted in a pose unexpected in this
context: they are seated cross-legged, carrying a model of a church as
an offering on a tray held above their heads (Fig. 4). One can
distinguish a church with a dome on an inscribed cross on the right and
a rotunda with an umbrella dome on the left. Inside the church, the four
heads of the 'living creatures' (or symbols of the evangelists) are
carved in the centre of the upper edge of the pendentives, at the foot
of the drum. Their small size is compensated by their rather strong
projection.

The façades are enriched by an arcade whose enlarged central portion is
surmounted by a high cross (Fig. 2). This solution, of Georgian
inspiration, as are the hanging festoons above the squinches that crown
the two eastern dihedral niches, was common at the time in Armenia. The
drum, in addition to the human figures already mentioned, has a very
rich vegetal and geometric ornamentation inspired by that of the drum of
Haṛich (1201), the first great Armenian sanctuary of the post-Seljuk
period (Fig. 2, 3). Inside the church, the sculpted
ornamentation, also prominent, adopts models then current in Armenia,
common to both the Armenian and Muslim repertoires: arabesques and very
elaborate interlacing, stalactites, broken sticks, etc. (Fig. 5). It adorns in particular the face of the elevation of the
apse, the lower face of the steps of the corbelled staircases, the upper
roll of the four central arches, the base belt of the drum and its
cylindrical inner wall.

The narthex (*zhamatun,* or *gawitʻ*) is, as usual, a little wider and
lower than the church in front of which it is built (Fig. 1, 2). The high thickness of its walls ensures full absorption of
the thrusts of the heavy vault. This type of building is mainly used in
Armenian monasteries as a burial place for members of the clergy and the
local princely dynasty. This is confirmed in Gandzasar by the numerous
tombstones and their inscriptions. The building has a sophisticated type
of covering, present in numerous Armenian narthexes of the 13<sup>th</sup>
century: its vault is supported by two pairs of crossed arches that rest
on supports leaning against the peripheral walls (Fig. 6); on
the west side, however, these arches are supported by a pair of free
columns, which allows for an extension of the building towards the west
(Fig. 1). In this respect, the narthex of Gandzasar is similar
to those of Haghbat and Mshkavankʻ (13<sup>th</sup> century, Republic of
Armenia). Inside, the vault that rises above the central square is
carved with stalactites (*muqarnas*), of impeccable craftsmanship, also
common at the time in Armenia, as well as on Seljuk monuments in Asia
Minor. The four-sloped roof of the *zhamatun* and the hexastyle lantern
above it were rebuilt in 1907.

On the outside, the *zhamatun* is distinguished by the considerable size
of the western portal and its rich decoration (Fig. 7).
Occupying almost the entire height of the façade, the composition uses
original formulas: inlaid intersecting circles on the tympanum, an
intermediate frame surrounding the door and the window, the rather
marked relief of two large peacocks on either side of the window and a
third large frame consisting of a wide torus whose decoration is
original. This curved band is decorated with alternating oval and
rectangular cartouches with very elaborate floral motifs, the treatment
of which is unusual for a stone sculpture. The motifs emerge not by
hollowing out the surface around them, but by digging out their inner
void spaces, a technique more reminiscent of chiselling on metal or wood
than of stone bas-relief. This powerful curved band continues
horizontally, without ornamentation, at the bottom of the walls of the
building, completing the series of steps that underline and strengthen
the base of this imposing construction.
