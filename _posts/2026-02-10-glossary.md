title:  "Glossary of Armenian Architecture"
---

We are pleased to announce a collaboration between the AIEA and the team behind the _Glossary of Armenian Architecture_ (Հայ ճարտարապետութեան բառարան), which was initiated by Prof. Patrick Donabédian and made possible with the scientific and technical support of [several collaborators](https://glossaire.am/fr/bienvenue/#nous). The glossary is now available [here](https://glossaire.am/).

On this occasion, we would also like to appeal for volonteers to accomplish the second part of the project: to translate and/or adapt this tool, for the moment only available in French and Armenian, into the main working languages of the international community.
