## Categories of membership

The AIEA has three categories of membership:

- Student members (students, doctorands);
- Regular members, for whom Armenian studies is a principal activity (researchers, professors);
- Associate members, for whom Armenian studies is not a principal activity but who have an interest in Armenian studies and questions.

## Becoming a member

To become a member of the AIEA, an application (covering letter and curriculum vitae) must be sent to the Secretary of the association, specifying the category of membership. Applications for full and associate membership must be supported in writing by two full members of the AIEA. The Committee may itself propose the candidature of a new member.

To become a student member, an application, including a curriculum vitae, must be sent to the AIEA Secretary.

An annual membership fee must be paid, to an account indicated to each member according to their nationality or place of residence. The membership fee is paid according to the calendar year.

At the AIEA General Assembly (Oxford, 11 August 2017), it was decided to offer a 50% reduction in the membership fee for members residing in countries included in the list of OECD countries, e.g. Armenia, Georgia, Egypt, Ukraine, Argentina, Belarus, Lebanon, Turkey, etc. You may check whether your country is on the list via this link: [OECD List](https://www.oecd.org/dac/financing-sustainable-development/development-finance-standards/DAC-List-ODA-Recipients-for-reporting-2021-flows.pdf).
